Must keep clear in mind what to do in Enter and what to do in Exit!
Do not mix them up!

For Decl, we can have several utility functions:
    1. Count how many child node of a given type, for dimension.
    2. Array serialization, for init value.
    3. Only add to symbol table in Exit!

And, we may need some utility function that could generate unique name
for duplicated name.
